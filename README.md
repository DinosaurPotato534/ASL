## Inspiration
According to the US National Institute of Health, individuals with hearing loss have 1.58 times higher odds of being under the global poverty line. This data is only for the US, where government support and schemes like Medicaid provide some degree of relief. Now, consider the plight of those in developing, underdeveloped, or conflict-ridden regions where such support is often scarce. For countless children in these corners of the world, impaired hearing and speech act as insurmountable barriers, robbing them of the chance at a good life. This alarming truth serves as our unwavering inspiration. Fueled by empathy and a deep sense of responsibility, we are committed to breaking these chains.
